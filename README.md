# about
// Description:
I am taylornpeter, a 14-year-old amateur game developer and website "designer". I code in languages like: Python, C, Java, Lua and HTML (if it is actually considered a programming language). I've made fairly basic games, like the word-guessing game on my GitHub page. I am a person who gets easily bored with stuff that I find interesting in the first place, which results in incomplete projects. I am trying my best to fight this kind of personality ;P
